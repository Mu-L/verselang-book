## Language Design

Talks covering Verse's core design as a functional logic language, its type system, and its formal foundations.

**[The Verse Programming Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5prkKOIilJg)**
:   Official introduction to Verse as a universal programming language for building interconnected virtual worlds and the metaverse.

**Beyond Functional Programming: A Taste of Verse** -- Simon Peyton Jones (& Tim Sweeney)
:   Introduces Verse as a functional logic language with existential variables, unification, and expressions that yield multiple values. Given at multiple venues in 2023:
:   [Lambda Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJv8rFap0Nw) (with Sweeney) | [ZuriHac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B5p9T4A2fY) | [Wheeler Lecture, Cambridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNaaP8BKr7Y) | [IRIF Paris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1-KQ3QDe0U) | [other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=832JF1o7Ck8)

**Verse: A New Functional Logic Language** -- Lennart Augustsson
:   What functional logic programming is about, what it looks like to program in Verse, and how meaning is given to programs using rewrite rules. Given at multiple venues:
:   [GOTO Copenhagen 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CXhiSddjAI) | [REBASE, SPLASH 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1n7bBanKYQ) | [Lambda World 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVfY1jxqS70)

**[On Creating a Virtual Machine for Verse](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icfp-splash-2025/rebase-2025-papers/4/On-creating-a-virtual-machine-for-Verse-a-language-for-programming-in-a-shared-real-)**
:   Saam Barati | REBASE, SPLASH 2025 (Singapore)
:   Covers AutoRTFM and a bespoke VM designed from scratch for Verse's runtime, object model, and bytecode interpreter.

**[Another Taste of Verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIiU-QGzcqc)**
:   Simon Peyton Jones | ZuriHac 2026
:   Sequel to the 2023 talk, focusing on types, patterns, and denotational semantics. How Verse unifies expressions, patterns, and types into the same thing.

## Research

Academic papers and their conference presentations.

**[The Verse Calculus: A Core Calculus for Deterministic Functional Logic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P2pz1Xtjww)**
:   Augustsson, Breitner, Claessen, Jhala, Peyton Jones, Shivers, Sweeney, Steele | ICFP 2023 (**Distinguished Paper**)
:   Presents the Verse Calculus with a small-step rewrite semantics, confluent for well-behaved terms, enabling lambda-calculus-style reasoning about functional logic programs.
